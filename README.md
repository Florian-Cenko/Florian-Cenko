## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, Java (general programming, object-oriented design)
- **Back-End Frameworks:** Flask, Spring Boot (basic web application development)
- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT-REACT (for frontend structure)
- **Tools:** Git & GitHub  (for version control and code collaboration)


## 📚 Currently Learning

- Web development with **Flask** (online course from Udemy)
- Python for **Data Science** and **Machine Learning** (online course from Udemy)

## 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are a few projects I'm proud of:

- 🔗 [**KU-Detection-And-Risk-Front-End**](https://github.com/Florian-Cenko/KU-Detection-And-Risk-Front-End)
- 🔗 [**KU-Detection-And-Risk-Back-End**](https://github.com/Florian-Cenko/KU-Detection-And-Risk-Back-End)

  My undergraduate thesis project focuses on quantifying technical knowledge concentration and developer dependency in software projects. I introduced two novel metrics:

  📊 Knowledge Unit Risk (KU Risk): 

  🧑‍💻 Employee Risk (Employee Risk): Evaluates the impact of losing specific team members.

  I also modified and extended an interactive risk visualization tool to support data-driven decision-making in knowledge and human resource management. The tool was applied to various open-source repositories for real-world relevance.
